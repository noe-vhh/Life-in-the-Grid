# Concept Documentation

## Parasitic/Symbiotic System Overview

### Core Concept
The system reimagines the creature relationships as a complex symbiotic partnership between two species: parasitic protectors and host creatures. This creates a more nuanced ecosystem where both species depend on each other for survival.

### Species Roles

#### Parasitic Protectors (Main Creatures)
- Feed on the blood of host creatures
- Protect hosts from predators
- Manage and guard territory
- Store and process their dead for fertility
- Slower reproduction, longer lifespan
- More intelligent, capable of complex behaviors

#### Host Creatures
- Provide blood sustenance to parasites
- Graze on plants from fertile ground
- More vulnerable to predators
- Faster reproduction rate
- Rely on parasites for protection
- Simpler behavior patterns

### Ecological Cycle
1. Dead creatures decompose in designated areas
2. Decomposition creates fertile ground
3. Plants grow in fertile areas
4. Host creatures eat plants
5. Parasites feed on host blood
6. Both species protect each other

### Gameplay Dynamics
- Players manage both species' populations
- Balance protection vs feeding needs
- Maintain territory and resources
- Handle predator threats
- Manage decomposition areas
- Ensure sustainable blood feeding

### Unique Features
- Complex interdependent relationships
- Natural resource cycle
- Territory management
- Protection mechanics
- Multiple species management
- Environmental impact system

This system creates a more complex and interconnected ecosystem, where success depends on maintaining balance between different species and managing resources effectively.
